# Thrice Language Specification

_Thrice_ is a programing language that is at least equivalent to C language,
meaning anything that can be written in C can be written in Thrice with
equivalent semantics.

Thrice tries to add the fallowing features to C language:

- compile-time calculations,
- generics,
- modules,
- packages,
- closures,
- tagged unions,
- tuples,
- resource management with RAII,
- immutability and invisibility by default.

And it removes the fallowing features to have a cleaner language:

- macros,
- implicit narrowing conversions,
- implicit array decay,
- empty parameter list meaning any,
- untyped variadic function arguments.

## Symbol

A _symbol_ is a semantic object.

## Source

A _source_ is a file that has UTF-8 encoded text in it, which is a list of
symbol definitions.

File extension of a source is `.tr`. Name of a source can only contain the
lowercase English letters, decimal digits and underscores. It cannot start with
a decimal digit.

## Modules

A _module_ is a directory, which might contain sources or submodules.

Name of a module has the same rules as the name of a source.

## Packages

A _package_ is a module that is not contained by a supermodule.

A source with the name `main` that is directly under the package directory is
called the _main source_ and it must have an entry point. All packages are
libraries. A package that has an entry point is also an executable at the same
time.

## Visibility

Visibility is whether a symbol can be accessed in the definition of another
symbol.

A symbol is always visible in the source it is defined in. It can be more
accessible using a visibility modifier. There are three visibility modifiers in
Thrice:

- `module` makes a symbol visible in the module it is defined in,
- `intern` makes a symbol visible in the package it is defined in,
- `extern` makes a symbol visible everywhere.

The main source is considered as a file outside of the package. Thus, it can
only access extern symbols of the executable package it is in.
